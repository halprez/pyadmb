## üçº Phase 1: Understanding Homebrew (Let's Start NOW)

### Step 1.1: What is Homebrew Really?

Think of Homebrew like an app store, but for command-line tools and libraries:

**Traditional Installation (what you're avoiding):**
```bash
# The pain you want to avoid
wget https://source-code.tar.gz
tar -xzf source-code.tar.gz
cd source-code
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
# Hope nothing breaks...
```

**Homebrew Installation (what we're building toward):**
```bash
# The magic you're creating
brew install admb
# Done! üéâ
```

### Step 1.2: Key Concepts (ELI5 Version)

**Formula = Recipe**
- A Ruby file that tells Homebrew "how to cook this software"
- Contains ingredients (dependencies) and cooking instructions (build steps)

**Tap = Recipe Book**
- A collection of formulas
- Can be official (homebrew-core) or personal (your cookbook)

**Cellar = Pantry**
- Where Homebrew stores the "cooked" software
- Each version gets its own shelf

### Step 1.3: Let's Look at Real Examples

Open Terminal and run these commands to see how this works:

```bash
# See where Homebrew lives
brew --prefix
# On Apple Silicon: /opt/homebrew
# On Intel Mac: /usr/local

# Look at an existing formula
brew info wget
# This shows you everything about the wget package

# See the actual recipe
brew cat wget
# This shows the Ruby code that builds wget
```

**üîç Exercise 1.3a:** Run these commands and paste the output. I want to see what your system shows!

## üõ† Phase 2: Set up Development Environment

### Step 2.1: Check Your Prerequisites

```bash
# Check if you have the basics
xcode-select --version
# Should show: xcode-select version 2395 (or similar)

git --version
# Should show: git version 2.x.x

brew --version
# Should show: Homebrew 4.x.x
```

**If any of these fail:**
- XCode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
- Git: Should come with XCode tools
- Homebrew: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`

### Step 2.2: Enable Formula Development Mode

This is the secret sauce that lets you create formulas:

```bash
# Enable local development
export HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1

# Add this to your shell profile so it persists
echo 'export HOMEBREW_NO_INSTALL_FROM_API=1' >> ~/.zshrc
# (or ~/.bash_profile if you use bash)

# Reload your shell
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 2.3: Your First Baby Formula

Let's create a tiny test formula to understand the process:

```bash
# Create a simple test formula
brew create --set-name hello-world https://github.com/github/hello-world/archive/v1.0.tar.gz
```

This creates a file at: `$(brew --repository homebrew/core)/Formula/h/hello-world.rb`

**üîç Exercise 2.3a:** Run this command and tell me:
1. Did it work?
2. What output did you get?
3. Can you find the created file?

### Step 2.4: Understanding the Generated Formula

Open the file that was created and look at its structure:

```ruby
class HelloWorld < Formula
  desc ""  # You'll fill this in
  homepage ""  # And this
  url "https://github.com/github/hello-world/archive/v1.0.tar.gz"
  sha256 "calculated_automatically"

  def install
    # This is where the magic happens
    # We'll learn to fill this in
  end

  test do
    # This is how we verify it worked
  end
end
```

## üéØ Phase 3: Create ADMB Formula (The Real Deal)

### Step 3.1: Research ADMB Build Process

Before writing the formula, we need to understand how ADMB builds. Let's do this together:

```bash
# Download ADMB source to understand it
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/admb-project/admb.git
cd admb

# Look at the build instructions
ls -la
cat README.md
cat INSTALL.md
```

**üîç Exercise 3.1a:** Run these commands and tell me:
1. What files do you see in the ADMB directory?
2. What does README.md say about building?
3. Are there any Makefiles?

### Step 3.2: Test Manual Build

Let's build ADMB manually first to understand what our formula needs to do:

```bash
# Try building ADMB manually
cd /tmp/admb
make
```

**üîç Exercise 3.2a:** 
1. Did the build work?
2. What output did you get?
3. Were there any errors?
4. What files were created?

### Step 3.3: Create ADMB Formula

Now we'll create the real ADMB formula:

```bash
# Create ADMB formula
brew create --set-name admb https://github.com/admb-project/admb/archive/admb-13.1.tar.gz
```

### Step 3.4: Edit the Formula

Open the created formula file and let's build it together. Here's our starting template:

```ruby
class Admb < Formula
  desc "Automatic Differentiation Model Builder"
  homepage "https://admb-project.org"
  url "https://github.com/admb-project/admb/archive/admb-13.1.tar.gz"
  sha256 "SHA_WILL_BE_CALCULATED"
  license "BSD-3-Clause"

  depends_on "gcc" => :build

  def install
    # We'll figure this out together based on your manual build
    system "make"
    system "make", "install", "PREFIX=#{prefix}"
  end

  test do
    # We'll create a simple test
    system "#{bin}/admb", "--version"
  end
end
```

## üß™ Phase 4: Testing and Debugging

### Step 4.1: Test Your Formula

```bash
# Test the formula syntax
brew audit --strict admb

# Try installing your formula
brew install --build-from-source admb

# If it works, test it
brew test admb
```

### Step 4.2: Debug Common Issues

When things go wrong (they will!), here's how to debug:

```bash
# Install with verbose output to see what's happening
brew install --build-from-source --verbose --debug admb

# If build fails, you can examine the build directory
# Homebrew will tell you where it is
```

## üöÄ Phase 5: Create Your Own Tap

### Step 5.1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub.com
2. Create new repository named `homebrew-pyadmb`
3. Make it public
4. Don't initialize with README (we'll add files)

### Step 5.2: Set Up Local Tap

```bash
# Create local tap directory
mkdir -p $(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/pyadmb/homebrew-pyadmb

# Initialize as git repository
cd $(brew --repository)/Library/Taps/pyadmb/homebrew-pyadmb
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/homebrew-pyadmb.git
```

### Step 5.3: Move Your Formula to Your Tap

```bash
# Create Formula directory
mkdir Formula

# Copy your working ADMB formula
cp $(brew --repository homebrew/core)/Formula/a/admb.rb Formula/admb.rb

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add ADMB formula"
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5.4: Test Public Installation

```bash
# Tap your repository
brew tap pyadmb/pyadmb

# Install from your tap
brew install pyadmb/pyadmb/admb
```

## üéâ Success Metrics

After each phase, you should be able to:

**Phase 1:** Explain what a Homebrew formula is and show examples
**Phase 2:** Have development environment set up and created a test formula  
**Phase 3:** Have a working ADMB formula that builds locally
**Phase 4:** Successfully install ADMB via your formula
**Phase 5:** Anyone can install ADMB using `brew tap pyadmb/pyadmb && brew install admb`

## üÜò When You Get Stuck

At each step, I want you to:

1. **Try the command**
2. **Copy/paste the exact output** (especially errors)
3. **Tell me what you expected vs what happened**
4. **Ask specific questions**

I'll help debug every single issue until it works perfectly.

## üéì Learning Outcomes

By the end, you'll understand:
- How package managers work internally
- The difference between source compilation and package installation
- Dependency management systems
- Cross-platform software distribution
- Ruby basics (you'll pick it up naturally)
- Git workflows for software distribution
